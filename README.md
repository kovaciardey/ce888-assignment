# ce888-assignment

The repository contains two files.

The first one "data_splitting.jpynb" is responsbile for creating data files that will in turn be loaded into the notebook for the model. 

The code assumes that both the Training and Test data sets are under a folder named "data". The relative path of each folder can be seen in the second cell of the notebook.

The second file "alex_net_flame_implementation.jpynb" is the training of the model.

My recomendation would be to execute the files locally on the PC. This and creating the data folder should ensure a succesful execution.

The data can be downloaded https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/flame-dataset-aerial-imagery-pile-burn-detection-using-drones-uavs
